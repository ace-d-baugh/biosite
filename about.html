                     <p>I’m Mark Adams! I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. As a young child and a product of the Eighties, I would sit on the floor of my living room, watching some of the greatest movies and TV shows to ever bless the small screen. I remember how I was captivated the first time I ever went to a large theater to see a movie on the big screen. This was a world of entertainment I had to be a part of. I found it hard to study in school until I made it to college where I studied Film History. Finally, a curriculum that matched my passion for the arts.</p>
                     <p>I decided to leave my home and college to pursue my dreams by working for an entrainment Goliath. I knew if I could get a foot in this well-known company, I could make my way to where I really wanted to be. The Walt Disney Company has opened its arms to me and given me many great experiences from opening new attractions and lands to leadership responsibilities. </p>
                     <p>During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself furloughed from the company I love and not able to go see movies in the theater. I joined forces with one of my best friends to create a podcast to talk about movies and pop culture that we love and the news of what is to come. Please join me and my friend, Bryan, as we hash out some of the most notable contributions to entertainment on “United We Fan”!</p>
