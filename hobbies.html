               <!-- Working Out Text -->
               <p>A few years back, Mark was given a physical and that day became a wake-up call. The physician told him his cholesterol was too high and that he needed to diet and exercise. Mark started simple with a jog every other day. This grew to adding weight training a couple of times a week. This meant he could still enjoy the food he wanted, but he had to work harder to get that luxury. He now runs 4 miles a day and weight training about three times a week. He hardly misses a day. He also participates in and coaches a company softball team that is undefeated.</p>

               <p>Mark has always loved movies. He couldnâ€™t tell you what the first movie he ever watched was, or who was in it, but he can tell you the euphoria he feels to this day as he walks into a movie theater with his bucket of popcorn and soda in hand and sits down just as the lights dim for the coming attractions. He has always been a fan of the blockbuster movie, but he also enjoys a more artistic style as well. As a member of the AMC A-List, he goes to watch a new movie every week, and with his good friend, Bryan, they give their insights and critiques on their podcast, United We Fan.</p>

               <!-- Trying Food Text -->
               <p>Growing up in the heart of New Orleans, Louisiana, Mark was introduced to Creole and Southern styles of cooking at a very young age. The medley flavors with a hint of heat never tired his taste buds. As he grew, he sought new foods to whet his appetite and satisfy his desire for something unique. Mark can often be found, even by himself, at a mom-and-pop or hole-in-the-wall type restaurant asking for the House Special. Buffets are a favorite as they give a lot of variety, but he will always go back to the comfort food of crawfish and gumbo.</p>
